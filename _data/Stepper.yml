introduction: >
  The stepper class encapsulates all physical properties of a stepper motor
    - Pin numbers of the STEP and DIR signals.
    - Maximum and pull-in speed of the motor (pull-in speed is the speed up to 
      which the motor can be started without the need for acceleration).
    - Settings for STEP and DIR pulse polarity, i.e., does your driver require 
      active high or active low step pulses. 

  In addition to those static properties the stepper class has member functions to set the 
  target position of a movement to an absolute potion or relative to the current position.
