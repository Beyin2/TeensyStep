## Overview

The following figure shoes a principal setup of a string winder. The string (blue) is rotated by the spindle motor. While the spindle rotates the feeder linearly moves in parallel to the string and winds a wire on the string. It is important that the ratio of the feeder speed and the spindle rotation stays constant even during acceleration and deceleration phases to keep a constant winding pitch.
